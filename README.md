# Vue.js Essentials Workshop

## Pre-requisites

1. Need to have prior web-dev experience. We won't cover HTML, CSS or JavaScript essentials although we'll touch up on some modern JavaScript primitives that we will be using extensively.
2. You need to have the latest [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. That's pretty much all that's required. If you're having an older Node.js release, you might face issues while following the workshop.
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended as we believe it has the best Vue.js DX. Other editors work too but we might not be able to help if you're facing issues.
4. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.org) is a faster npm. We'll be using Yarn for our main project.

## Structure of this Repository

We follow a branch-based progress. You can find individual lessons by checking out the various labelled branches (e.g. `00-start.md`). On each branch, you'll find the following structure:

```
